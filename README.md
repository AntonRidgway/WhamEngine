# WhamEngine
C++ game engine programmed in 2012 for the Advenced Game Programming course (CS-5863-02) at the University of Tulsa. Contains (among other things) OpenGL rendering, memory management, and Bullet physics integration. Cleaned up for GitHub in 2015.

The code should compile on most Windows systems from the included Visual Studio solution.

Also incorporates headers, .lib's, and .dll's from multiple open-source libraries:
- [OpenGLUT](http://openglut.sourceforge.net/), for window management.
- [Bullet 2](http://bulletphysics.org/), for physics.
- [Assimp](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/), for asset importing.
- [RapidXML](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/), for XML importing.
Assets are all original, except for the Sinbad model and the "BobLampClean" guard model.
